# -fraud-detection-credit-card
An analytical project on fraud detection and transaction trends using SQL and Power BI.

Project Title
Fraud Detection and Transaction Trends in Credit Card Data

Project Description
This project analyzes credit card transactions from 2019-2020 to detect fraudulent activities, understand customer spending behavior, and assess merchant performance. Using SQL Server for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, the study examines over one million records to uncover transaction patterns and anomalies.

Key Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and detecting outliers using Z-scores.
âœ… Customer Analysis: Spending trends, transaction frequency, and high-value customers.
âœ… Merchant Performance: Revenue trends and fraud risk assessment.
âœ… Fraud Detection: Identifying anomalies and comparing fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
âœ… Dashboards: Interactive Power BI dashboards for insights.

Technologies Used
SQL Server
Power BI
Excel (for initial data exploration)

Dataset
The dataset contains 1M+ transactions with key fields such as id, trans_date_trans_time, amt, is_fraud, merchant, and customer demographics.

SQL Queries
Key queries for fraud detection and transaction trends can be found in the SQL Queries/ folder.

Visualizations
Screenshots of Power BI dashboards are available in the Power BI Dashboard/ folder.


How to Run This Project
Import the dataset into SQL Server.
Run the SQL scripts to analyze customer, merchant, and fraud data.
Load the cleaned data into Power BI for visualization.
Use the Power BI dashboard to explore insights.

Results and Insights
ðŸ“Œ Fraudulent transactions have higher transaction amounts.
ðŸ“Œ Merchant "Fraud_Padberg_Welch" had the highest fraud rate (33.9%).
ðŸ“Œ Customer spending declined from $419,210.75 in 2019 to $62,102.18 in 2020.

Future Improvements
Implement real-time fraud detection using Machine Learning.
Automate anomaly detection using Python.
